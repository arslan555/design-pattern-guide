Lightening Thoughts
---
* Simplicity is not feature reduction
 Simplifying a programming model does not reduce its functionality. Simplification merely hides the complex logic behind framework code or reusable components.In essence, it shifts complexity from one part of the system that needs explicit management by application developers to another part invisible to most developers. 

* Never get scared of failing or mistakes coz' that's how you learn. However, try your best to fail as quickly as possible.

*  what drives us to use certain approaches, tools and techniques during building the software products? Its the way we understand the nature of problem dictates everything what we do to solve the problem. And everything is about making the choices. It starts with the design approaches. Test Driven Development, Behavior-driven Design ...
*  When we think of making reusable components, question is how far you need to or how granular you need to get. A person who need to build a table, he can either buy all those tools and raw woods or he can buy one of those assembles or the last option is fully readymade one, all depends on his ability, interest, requirements and flexibility he is looking for. However, as furniture dealer, what you want to sell? do you just want to sell just tools and woods or self assemble furniture or readymade one? I believe most of them want to sell all options because that covers the all possible market. And that's exactly my point when building reusable components. All components doesn't need to be pieces of woods and tools but some could be sold as bigger piece may be built using those granular components so that user doesnt always has to start from scratch.
